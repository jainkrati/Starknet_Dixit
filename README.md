On chain Dixit(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi4MoW6NuaQ&t=5s) developed for Starknet hack with MatchBox DAO
### `npm start`

How the game will work:

The first player generates the game code and invites other players. We need min 3 players to start.
Each player gets 3 cards.
Each round one player is randomly chosen to put a card out with a matching yet ambiguous description. Other players are supposed to put one card out as well. So each round we will see n cards from n players + 1 system generated card.
Next all cards put out by players will be presented and based on the card which gets highest vote round winner will be decided.

Smart contract for voting is partially done and deployed at https://www.loom.com/share/7be3b0ae4ae34304bdb563b50c0b308d
The winner player gets a winning NFT for which the on-chain NFT code is present under Contracts folder.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
